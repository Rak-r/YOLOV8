# YOLOV8

This repo consists of the demo scripts for running YOLOV8 fpor object detection tasks on videos and images. In order to integrate the object detection algorithm with real cmaeras such as depth cameras. I tried ti use intel realsense D435i for testing.
To integrate the intel stereo camera, follow the requiremnets below:
1. Install the python wrapper for realsense camera: `pip install pyrealsense2`
2. Install the ultralytics package for YOLOV8: `pip install ultralytics`
3. Install opencv for real-time video capturing: `pip install opencv-python`
